#### Abstract

One of common practices in financial industry to calculate correlation between
different stock returns is to use daily closed prices. In this project, we propose new
methods to compute correlation matrix that uses real stock data based on transaction
level. We use both Brownian bridge and linear interpolation to interpolate prices of all
stocks at any given specific time.

#### Knowledge and Tools
